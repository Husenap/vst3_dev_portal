Whenever **VST**® is used or the SDK has been used to create a product or the SDK is included (Open-source [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) case), it is required to add the reference to [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/) by using the **VST compatible logo** as supplied by [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/). Included in the VST SDK, the **VST compatible logo** can be found in the folder *VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/vst3_doc/artwork*.

This logo exists in different forms: with and without the trademark text, black on white and white on black. If you choose the logo without the trademark text, you have to include the following statement somewhere:

>*"VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, registered in Europe and other countries."*

## 1. Required use of VST Compatible logo

Whenever “**VST**” is used, or the SDK is used to create a product, or when the SDK is included, it is required to add the reference to Steinberg by using the “**VST Compatible logo**” as supplied by Steinberg on each of the following:

1. on package
2. on website:

The **VST Compatible logo** must be shown on every webpage that relates to such a product or shows **VST**. Using e.g. only within the imprint is NOT sufficient.

3. all documentation, regardless of the media used, such as PDF manuals, website, printed manuals etc.


On each of the following the logo can be omitted only if not enough space is available. However, in such a case be sure to include Steinberg's copyrights notice:

1. on all advertising materials
2. in the "about box" or similar (e.g. help menu, startup screen) of the product.

## 2. Use of VST unrelated to the VST Compatible logo

It is allowed for all parties that have entered into the current Steinberg **VST** Plug-in SDK Licensing Agreement to use “**VST**” in regular letters to refer to compatibility as long as complying with the Agreement. This can be done on the package/website or even within the name of the product as long as the form of use is in line with the Agreement and the **VST Compatible logo** is always shown in the context of such. The following shall provide more guidance related to common forms of usage.

## 3. Use when claiming compatibility

It is allowed to use claims such as “**compatible with 64-bit VST**” if the **VST Compatible logo** is placed in context of such claim, e.g. not too far away on the same page, and the product uses or has been created using the SDK and is, in fact, compatible.

## 4. Use on website

It is not sufficient to include the **VST Compatible logo** only in the imprint or one other page. All pages that relate to a product using or created using the SDK or showing VST must show the VST Compatible logo.

## 5. Use on package

The **VST Compatible logo** must be printed on the package of any product using or created using the SDK or showing **VST**.
