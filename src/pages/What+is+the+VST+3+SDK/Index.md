## VST 3 SDK explained

The **VST 3 SDK** (Virtual Studio Technology Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools included in one package. This allows plug-in developers to create plug-ins in **VST 3** format and host developers to load **VST 3** plug-ins into a DAW or audio editor.

## What is included

The **VST 3 SDK** package contains:


>**The VST 3 API**<br>
>This is a **C++ interface** defining how a **VST 3** plug-in communicates with a host and vice versa. The heart of **VST 3**.
>
>Check the folder *"pluginterfaces/vst"* of the SDK!


>**VST 3 Implementation Helper Classes**<br>
>Some helper classes are provided, implementing some **VST 3** interfaces for hosting and for creating **VST 3** plug-ins. Simply derived your plug-in C++ classes from these helper classes.

## [AAX, AUv3, AU and VST 2 wrappers](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Wrappers/Index.md)

These wrappers allows you to create versions of your **VST 3** plug-in in other plug-in formats with minimum effort:
- **[AAX](http://apps.avid.com/aax-portal/)** format used by Pro ToolsÂ®
- **[AUv3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox)** and **AU** (Audio Unit) on Apple platform
- **VST 2** (deprecated)

Check the folder *"public.sdk/source/vst/aaxwrapper"* of the SDK!

## [VST 3 Plug-ins Examples](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Plug-in+Examples.md)

The SDK includes some Plug-ins implementation examples. The Legendary **AGain** and **ADelay**, thanks Paul Kellet the Open-source **mda** Plug-ins, a basic "Note Expression Synth" supporting "**Note Expression Event**", an example of **pitchnames** support Plug-in, a **VST3 Host Checker** which checks if a host is VST3 compliant and more...

## [VST 3 Plug-in Test Host](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Plug-in+Test+Host.md)

The SDK provides a test application called **VST3PluginTestHost** for Apple Mac OS X (i386/x86_64) and Microsoft Windows (32bits, 64bits).<br>
This application allows you to load a plug-in, simulates some inputs (Audio and Event) and acts like a small **VST 3** host application based on an **ASIO** driver.<br>
Included in this application is a test module which allows you to check your plug-in in regard to the **VST 3** standard.

## Validator command line

>**as Cross-platform source code**<br>
>The ***validator*** is a small command line host application (source code included) which can be used to check your > plug-in for VST 3 conformity. You can also write your own test code and let the **validator** execute it. Very nice for > automatic build server integration.
>
>Check the folder *"public.sdk/samples/vst-hosting/validator"* of the SDK!

## AudioHost

>**as Cross-platform source code**<br>
>Simple cross-platform (only tested on Linux) host application allowing you to register a VST 3 plug-in with Jack Server. First, you have to download the Jack Audio SDK and application server (<http://www.jackaudio.org>).<br>
>- Windows (not tested): audiohost.exe "C:\PATH_TO_PLUGIN"
>- macOS (not tested)
>- Linux: audiohost PATH_TO_PLUGIN
>
>On Windows and macOS, you can also drag and drop a **VST 3 plug-in** on the executable via Explorer/Finder.
>
>Check the folder *"public.sdk/samples/vst-hosting/audiohost"* of the SDK!

## EditorHost

>**as Cross-platform source code**<br>
>Simple cross-platform (Win/macOS/Linux) host application allowing you to open the editor of a VST3 plug-in (with HiDPI > support on Windows/macOS). Call it from the command line: Windows: editorhost.exe "C:\PATH_TO_PLUGIN" macOS/Linux: > editorhost PATH_TO_PLUGIN
>
>On Windows and macOS you can also drag and drop a **VST 3 plug-in** on the executable via Explorer/Finder.
>
>Check the folder *"public.sdk/samples/vst-hosting/editorhost"* of the SDK!

## VST3 Inspector

``` admonish info
**as Cross-platform source code**<br>
Simple cross-platform (Win/macOS/Linux) host application, built with VSTGUI, which scans the VST3 Folder, collects > information from the factory about each VST3 plug-in and display it in its UI.
```

## [VSTGUI](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/VSTGUI.md)

This is a user interface toolkit mainly for audio plug-ins (VST, AudioUnit, etc). Based on the XML definition of the plug-in UI, **VSTGUI** includes an embedded editor (UIDescription Editor) which allows the developer to create a plug-in UI just by drag & drop of the UI element.

First developed in-house by Steinberg Media Technologies (around 1998) for their first VST plug-ins. Later added as binary libraries to the official **VST SDK**. Since May 2003, **VSTGUI** is open source, and is hosted now at GitHub <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vstgui>.

The last official release version of **VSTGUI** is always included in the **VST 3 SDK**.

## [VST 3 Project Generator](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Project+Generator.md)

This open source application (Win/macOS) allows you to generate easily a new **VST 3** plug-in project by just entering in a GUI some parameters.
