## [Building the examples included in the SDK on Windows](Building+the+examples+included+in+the+SDK+Windows.md)

This tutorial explains how to set up your computer and create an environment for compiling the **VST 3** audio plug-in examples provided with the **VST 3 SDK**.
## [Building the examples included in the SDK on macOS](Building+the+examples+included+in+the+SDK+macOS.md)

This tutorial explains how to set up your computer and create an environment for compiling the **VST 3** audio plug-in examples provided with the **VST 3 SDK**.

## [Building the examples included in the SDK on Linux](Building+the+examples+included+in+the+SDK+Linux.md)

This tutorial explains how to set up your computer and create an environment for compiling the **VST 3** audio plug-in examples provided with the **VST 3 SDK**.

## [Using cmake for building VST 3 plug-ins](Using+cmake+for+building+plug-ins.md)

This tutorial explains how to use *cmake* with **VST 3 SDK**.

## [Generate a new plug-in with the Project Generator App](Generate+new+plug-in+with+Project+Generator.md)

This tutorial explains how to create a new audio plug-in by using the ***[VST 3 Project Generator](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Project+Generator.md)*** included in the **VST 3 SDK**.

## [Code your first plug-in](Code+your+first+plug-in.md)

Following the previous tutorial [Generate a new plug-in with the Project Generator App](Generate+new+plug-in+with+Project+Generator.md), this tutorial explains how to code an audio plug-in and how to add some basic features.

## [Use VSTGUI to design a User Interface](Use+VSTGUI+to+design+a+UI.md)

This tutorial explains how to use [**VSTGUI**](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/VSTGUI.md). [**VSTGUI**](../What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/VSTGUI.md) comes with a *WYSIWYG* editor that allows you to create stunning user interfaces for your plug-in.

## [Advanced VST 3 techniques](Advanced+VST+3+techniques.md)

In this tutorial you will learn:

- How to add nearly sample accurate parameter changes to an audio effect
- Using C++ templates to write one algorithm supporting 32 bit and 64 bit audio processing
- Setting the state of the audio effect in a thread safe manner

## [How to use the silence flags](How+to+use+the+silence+flags.md)

This tutorial explains how to use silence flags.

## [Strings Conversion Helper](Strings+Conversion+Helper.md)

The SDK provides some helpers functions to convert from UTF16 (use in VST 3 interfaces) to UTF8 (used by std::string).

## [Creating a plug-in from the Helloworld template](Creating+a+plug-in+from+the+Helloworld+template.md)

This tutorial explains how to create a new audio plug-in from the Helloworld template included in the **VST 3 SDK**.
